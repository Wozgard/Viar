# My very long project

I worked on this project for half a year. I quit and started again. Stumbled. Learning something new, I rewrote the code already written earlier. And now my project is almost ready.

## Skills that I got

In this project, I perfected BEM and SCSS. I learned a lot about JavaScript, understood how to send asynchronous requests to the server, learned how closures work, Promises and learned ES6. Once again I worked with the Gulp assembler. And set up Git branches for the first time.
